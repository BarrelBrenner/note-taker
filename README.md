Here is application for note-taker

For this assignment you will need to install npm, to install it type in the following -- "npm init -y" -- which will give you a package.json file. After that you can install the dependencies required for your application to run. For this example it calls for express, fs, nodemon & path, so to install those I would type the following -- "npm i express", then "npm i fs", then "npm i nodemon" & finally "npm i path".

Once that's finished you can begin running the application on server side which is titled the following --"node server.js".

This application is used for adding, deleting & saving of notes for upcoming ideas/events, followups & more.

You can create new notes by clicking on pen icon in top right. You can save item by clicking on floppy disk icon on top right beside pen icon. You can delete item by clicking on trash can icon beside message you wish to delete.

Thank you for your time & take care.
