Here is application for note-taker

For this assignment you will need to install npm, to install it type in the following -- "npm init -y" -- which will give you a package.json file. After that you can install the dependencies required for your application to run. For this example it calls for express, fs, nodemon & path, so to install those I would type the following -- "npm i express", then "npm i fs", then "npm i nodemon" & finally "npm i path".

Once that's finished you can begin running the application on server side which is titled the following --"node server.js".

This application is used for adding, deleting & saving of notes for upcoming ideas/events, followups & more.
